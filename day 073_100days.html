	<h2>Wow, One Hundred Days?!</h2>
	<p>Let's start with some simple code to get a simple output (the information the program gives to the user).</p>

	<h2>Taking user input</h2>
	<p>Let's take a look at the input command and how that works. Input is when the user gives information to the computer.</p>

	<h2>Concatenate</h2>
	<p>All it really means is combine text (remember, text is called a string) and variables together into single sentences! ðŸ˜²ðŸ¤¯</p>

	<h2>Everyone loves a good story!</h2>
	<p>Well, you're going to create your own adventure story that places your user in the role of the main character and we'll even customize the story to suit their interests.</p>

	<h2>If Statements</h2>
	<p>These statements are a bit like asking a question. You are telling the computer: if something is true, then do this specific block of code. Double equals (==) is asking the computer to compare if these two things are exactly the same.</p>
